						As a leading private business in Juba, Acacia Village is committed to the highest
						standards of business integrity, social responsibility and environmental impact. From
						water recycling to a reduction in single-use plastic, we are constantly striving to
						minimise our carbon footprint. In 2016, we installed a captive solar plant with our
						sister company Equator Energy, which has reduced our diesel consumption by more than
						50%. <br /> With the support of Marisâ€™ dedicated E&S Officer, Acacia Village developed
						its own Environmental, Social and Governance Management System (ESMS) in 2018 in
						accordance with the IFC Performance Standards and World Bank guidelines.<br /> Acacia Village
						is proud to support the local community through direct employment and a range of outreach
						programmes including the funding of the Acacia football team. In addition to the local labour
						laws of South Sudan, we subscribe to the core labour standards of the International Labour
						Organisation (ILO). In terms of corporate governance and business integrity, our policies
						include Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, and Whistleblowing.
